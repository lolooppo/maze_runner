# maze_runner
## This is a simple console maze game which challenges the player to finish the maze within a specified time based on the chosen level.

#### The game consits of three levels with 3 time limits for each level:
- Easy 7x7 grid with 30 seconds limit.
- Medium 15x15 grid with 60 seconds limit.
- Hard 20x20 grid with 100 seconds limit.
#### I used Rendomized DFS algorithm to generate the maze.
